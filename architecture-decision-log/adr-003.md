# 3. Use NATS for Inter-Service Communication

Date: 2025-04-08

Status: proposed

Author: Oliver Schlüter

## Problem

As part of our microservices architecture, services often need to communicate with each other. 
While some interactions are well-suited for synchronous HTTP/gRPC calls (e.g., request/response for user data), others benefit from asynchronous messaging—such as AI requests, background processing, notification or loosely-coupled event-driven workflows.

We want to introduce a messaging system that enables:
- **Asynchronous, decoupled communication** between services
- **Publish-subscribe (pub/sub)** and **message queue** patterns
- Lightweight setup and operation suitable for local development and small teams
- Good performance and reliability for basic event-driven workflows

We considered several messaging solutions:
- **RabbitMQ:** Mature and feature-rich but heavier and more complex to configure.
- **Kafka:** Very powerful for large-scale, persistent event streams, but overkill for our current scale and harder to run locally.
- **Redis Streams / PubSub:** Simple to use, but lacks strong messaging semantics and durability guarantees.
- **NATS:** Lightweight, extremely fast, supports multiple messaging patterns, and has a simple developer experience.

## Decision

We have decided to use **NATS** as our messaging system for inter-service communication.

NATS is a lightweight, high-performance messaging platform that supports pub/sub, request/reply, and streaming patterns. 
It is easy to install and run locally using Docker, with minimal configuration. 
NATS provides the flexibility we need to implement event-driven communication between our microservices without introducing heavy operational complexity. 
Its performance is well-suited for our small-to-medium use case, and it allows us to scale or evolve our messaging approach later if needed (e.g. by introducing NATS JetStream for persistence or at-least-once delivery).

We will use NATS primarily for:
- Publishing domain events (e.g., "UserRegistered", "LessonCompleted")
- Triggering async workflows (e.g., sending welcome emails)
- Decoupling services that do not require synchronous responses

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enables loosely coupled, scalable communication between services
- Simple to set up and run, great for local development and CI
- High performance with low resource usage
- Supports multiple messaging patterns (pub/sub, request/reply)
- Easy to learn and integrate

**Negative:**
- Fewer enterprise-level features compared to Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Must manage and monitor the NATS server as a shared infrastructure component
