## Problem

We are developing a web application as part of a university project. Although we are a single team of four developers, we want to design the system as if it were a real-world production-grade application.

We aim to:
- Gain hands-on experience with modern software architecture patterns
- Learn to work with cloud-native tooling and DevOps practices
- Understand the operational and technical tradeoffs of microservices

The application has multiple logical domains (e.g., Backend, AI, Simulation, Mail), which suggests a natural separation of concerns.

We considered the following architectural options:

**Monolithic Architecture**:

Simple to implement and deploy, ideal for small teams and tight deadlines. However, it doesn't give us experience with distributed systems or scaling practices.

**Modular Monolith**:

Provides some structure and separation of concerns while keeping deployment simple. A good compromise, but doesn't challenge us with service independence or infrastructure-level concerns.

**Microservices Architecture** *(chosen)*:

More complex to set up and operate but offers realistic experience with service isolation, API design, inter-service communication, and infrastructure automation.


## Decision

We are going to adopt a microservices architecture for our application. 
Each service will encapsulate a specific business domain and be developed, deployed, and tested independently. 
Inter-service communication will primarily use HTTP/REST or CloudEvents/NATS, while asynchronous messaging will be explored for cases that benefit from decoupling and eventual consistency. 
Services will manage their own databases or schemas to ensure loose coupling and domain ownership. 
To support this architecture, we will containerize each service using Docker and orchestrate them locally using Docker Compose, with the option to explore Kubernetes if time permits. 
Additionally, we will implement basic observability features such as health checks, centralized logging, and monitoring, and we will set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to support automated testing and deployment.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Realistic exposure to production-grade architecture
- Better domain separation and codebase organization
- Opportunity to work with modern tools and practices (containers, service discovery, CI/CD, etc.)
- Scalable and maintainable structure

**Negative:**
- Added complexity for a small team and a time-limited project
- More infrastructure setup and operational overhead
- Potential for overengineering
- Steeper learning curve and slower early progress
