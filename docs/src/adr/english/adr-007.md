# 7. Grafana Loki for logging

Date: 2025-07-04

Status: draft

Author: Oliver Schlüter

## Problem

We need a centralized, efficient, and scalable logging solution that allows us to:
- Aggregate logs from multiple services and environments.
- Search and visualize logs with structured metadata (e.g., service, environment, level).
- Correlate logs with metrics and traces for full observability.
- Keep costs low while supporting high-volume log ingestion.
- Avoid complex infrastructure with heavy resource requirements (e.g., ELK stack).

Traditional solutions like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-based logging (e.g., Datadog, Logz.io) either come with high cost, operational complexity, or limited flexibility for on-premise deployments.

## Decision

We will use Grafana Loki as our centralized log aggregation and querying system.

Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.
It is designed to be cost-effective and integrates seamlessly with the Grafana ecosystem.

Key reasons for choosing Loki:
- Label-based indexing (not full-text), which keeps storage usage and operational cost low.
- Tight integration with Grafana, enabling unified dashboards for metrics, logs, and traces.
- Simple architecture, easy to deploy via Docker, Kubernetes, or as a standalone binary.
- Supports Promtail, Fluent Bit, and other log shippers for collecting logs.
- Free and open-source, with enterprise features available only if needed later.

## Consequences

Positive:
- Cost-Efficient: Minimal indexing and efficient storage reduce infrastructure costs.
- Scalable: Works well with Kubernetes, Docker, and distributed environments.
- Unified Observability: Easily correlate logs with metrics and traces inside Grafana.
- Flexible: Can collect logs from files, journald, Docker, or systemd with Promtail or Fluent Bit.
- Open Source: No vendor lock-in; fully self-hosted and free to use.
- Operational Simplicity: Easier to run and maintain than ELK-based setups.

Negative
- Limited Full-Text Search: Loki is optimized for label-based search, not full-text indexing (though it supports regex and filters).
- Learning Curve for Labels: Efficient querying depends on label design and familiarity with Loki’s query language (LogQL).
- No Native Alerting on Logs: Requires pairing with Grafana alerting or third-party tools to generate alerts from logs.
