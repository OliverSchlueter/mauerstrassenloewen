# 6. Use Qdrant for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Search

Date: 2025-07-04

Status: draft

## Problem

We need a vector database to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search use cases. The system must be able to:
- Store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings.
- Handle hybrid search (semantic + keyword filtering).
- Scale with growing document collections.
- Integrate easily with our AI model serving and embedding pipelines.
- Be free to use and deployable in local or cloud environments.

Alternatives like Pinecone, Weaviate, and Vespa offer similar capabilities but come with trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity, or cloud dependency. 
We want a solution that’s fast, production-ready, open-source, and gives us full control over deployment and data.

## Decision

We will use Qdrant as our vector database for RAG and semantic search functionality.

Qdrant provides a high-performance, production-grade vector search engine with the following benefits:
- Native support for filtering, metadata, and hybrid queries (vector + payload).
- Docker-based deployment and cloud-agnostic scalability.
- Excellent performance for ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) search.
- REST API with solid documentation.
- Compatible with common embedding models.
- Fully open-source and free to use with an active community and commercial support options if needed.

## Consequences

Positive:
- Efficient RAG Implementation: Enables fast semantic retrieval of relevant documents to improve LLM responses.
- Ease of Use: Clear APIs and SDKs simplify integration into our pipeline.
- Scalable and Fast: High-performance vector indexing with support for filtering and real-time updates.
- Free and Open Source: No licensing or usage fees; can be self-hosted.
- Docker and Kubernetes Friendly: Easy to deploy in dev, staging, and production environments.

Negative:
- Index Tuning: Performance tuning (e.g., HNSW parameters) may require experimentation.
- Learning Curve: Some familiarity with vector-based retrieval concepts is required.
- No Built-in UI: Unlike some competitors (e.g., Weaviate), Qdrant lacks an integrated UI for data exploration (though external tools exist).
