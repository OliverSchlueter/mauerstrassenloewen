# 4. MongoDB as the primary database

## Problem

For our project, we need a database solution that can handle a variety of business data types, is flexible enough to evolve as we iterate on the project, and can scale as we add more functionality over time.

We considered the following database options for storing general business data:
- **Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):** Structured, mature, and reliable. However, they can be rigid with schema changes and may require complex migrations for evolving data models.
- **NoSQL Document Databases (e.g., MongoDB):** Highly flexible, allowing us to store semi-structured data with dynamic schemas, and scale horizontally as needed.
- **Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB):** Good for caching and fast lookups, but not ideal for handling complex business data with varying relationships.

## Decision

We have decided to use **MongoDB** for storing our general/business data. 
MongoDB allows us to store data in a flexible, schema-less format as JSON-like documents, which gives us the freedom to quickly evolve the structure of our data as the application grows. 
This flexibility is important as our project is likely to undergo multiple iterations during development, and MongoDB allows us to adapt the data model without complex migrations or constraints.

Key reasons for choosing MongoDB:
- **Schema Flexibility:** We can store data in a flexible, JSON-like format (BSON) without requiring a fixed schema upfront.
- **Horizontal Scalability:** MongoDB's native sharding allows for scaling horizontally as we add more data or services.
- **Ease of Use:** It has a simple query language and integrates well with the modern tech stack we are using
- **Good Ecosystem and Community Support:** MongoDB has great documentation, client libraries, and a strong community.
- **Data Model Fit:** MongoDB’s document-based data model aligns well with our need to represent entities.

Each microservice will have its own MongoDB database to ensure loose coupling between services, and the database will be managed independently by each service.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Flexibility in storing dynamic and evolving business data
- Ease of scaling as the application grows, especially in horizontal scaling scenarios
- Fast and efficient for read-heavy applications with varied data types
- Simple integration with modern development frameworks and languages
- Good developer experience with MongoDB drivers and native query support

**Negative:**
- Potential data consistency challenges in distributed environments (e.g., eventual consistency issues in some scenarios)
- Not as strong in handling complex transactional requirements across multiple services (compared to relational databases)
- MongoDB does not have strong ACID guarantees in the same way as relational databases, which may require us to rethink how we handle certain operations (e.g., multistep transactions or joins)
