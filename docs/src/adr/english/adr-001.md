# 1. Establish ADR Process

Status: draft

Author: Oliver Schl√ºter

## Problem

The architecture of a software system is a critical aspect that influences its design, development, and maintenance.
However, architecture decisions are often made in an ad-hoc manner, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in understanding the rationale behind certain choices.
This ADR aims to establish a structured approach to record architecture decisions, ensuring that they are documented, communicated, and accessible to all stakeholders.

**Alternatives:**

- Do not record architecture decisions
- Use a different format (e.g., plain text, PDF)
- Store ADRs in a different location
- Use a different framework or template for ADRs

## Decision

All architectural decisions must be recorded using Markdown-based ADRs following the template defined in this document.
ADRs will be stored in the `docs/src/adr/` directory of the GitHub repository, to take advantage of the history and versioning features of Git.
Filenames will use the format: `adr-XXXX.md`, where `XXXX` is a zero-padded index (e.g., `adr-0001.md`).

**Each ADR must include the following sections:**

- **Header**: Metadata about the decision, including the date, status, and author
- **Problem**: A brief description of the problem being addressed and the context in which the decision is made
- **Decision**: A clear and concise statement of the decision made
- **Consequences**: The implications of the decision, including any trade-offs or potential risks
- **References**: Any relevant documents, links, or resources that provide additional context or information about the decision

**The states of the ADR can be:**

- **Proposed**: The ADR is proposed and not yet accepted
- **Accepted**: The ADR is accepted and implemented
- **Superseded by XXXX**: The ADR is no longer relevant and has been replaced by a new decision
- **Supersedes XXXX**: The ADR replaces a previous decision

## Consequences

- Every time an architecture decision is made, there is a need to create a new ADR entry in the log
- Every architecture decision must be reviewed and approved by all team members in order to be accepted
- We do not modify existing ADR entries, but we can add new ones to clarify or update previous decisions
